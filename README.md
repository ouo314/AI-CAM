#Objective: To create a camera with AI recognition functionality.

## SoC
I tried selecting from available development boards on the market, 
but many of them are not sold on LSCS (such as SG2002, RTL8735...), 
or they have very limited reference materials. Ultimately, I found the K210, 
which has many open-source development boards and plenty of related resources.
